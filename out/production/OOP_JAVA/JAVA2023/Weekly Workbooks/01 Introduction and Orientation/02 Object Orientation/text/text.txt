In the previous teaching block, you learnt to program in C (to varying degrees of success ;o). In this unit however, you will be using **Java** and as such the _organisation_ of your code _should_ be very different. There are a number of key concepts that are fundamental to **Object Oriented** code. Before we progress to any hands-on practical exercises, it is important that you have an appreciation of these concepts. The first session of this unit introduced a lot of these concepts - if you missed this session (or feel you need to recap on the topics covered), view the slides and video above. At this stage, we have only introduced the concepts at a very high level - we will revisit them again in later workbooks.
