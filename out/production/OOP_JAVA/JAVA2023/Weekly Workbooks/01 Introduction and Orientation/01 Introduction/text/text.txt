Welcome to this first practical workbook for the Object Oriented Programming with Java unit.
The aim of these workbooks is to present key theoretical concepts that underlie the unit and 
give you the opportunity to apply these in practical exercises.

Where you see the blue "Slides" and "Video" buttons at the top of a section, 
you should view these _before_ attempting the practical activities described in that section. 
You should do this now for this current task - this will present an introduction to
Java and provide you with a high-level understanding of the nature of Object Orientation.
Note that it is easier to "clone" these workbooks and view them locally on your own computer
(rather than trying to browse them online via the GitHub website).

One of the reasons we focus on Java in this unit is that it is a very popular and marketable
programming language. Before moving on to the main tasks in this workbook, you might like to watch

to see how Java's popularity has changed over the years.
